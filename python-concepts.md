# Python Tutorial

## Syntax

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of the code line. 

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

## Variables

If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

ex.

```
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```
